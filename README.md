 Using the ROOT framework and data from the Pierre Auger collaboration we study the distribution of the Xmax variable, the depth at which a cosmic rays is most developed, and a new smeared Xmax is created to simulate the resolution of the experiment:

then a ROC curve is built studying the contamination of the distribution of the different xmax values from different rays
